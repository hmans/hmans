Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Most of the opensourcey stuff I'm doing at the moment revolves around tooling for HTML5-native game development. Here are some of the projects I'm working on:

- [Miniplex](https://github.com/hmans/miniplex), a gentle entity manager for games based on ECS architecture.
- [VFX](https://github.com/hmans/vfx), a high-performance, game-ready visual effects library for react-three-fiber.
- [ControlFreak](https://github.com/hmans/controlfreak), composable multi-device game input.
- [Ingrid](https://github.com/hmans/ingrid), an implementation of Spatial Hash Grids.
- [Trinity](https://github.com/hmans/trinity), a very WIP framework for rapid game development that ties many of these things together.

Other noteworthy stuff I've published in the past:

- [Statery](https://github.com/hmans/statery), a simple proxy-based state container for React.
- [three-elements](https://github.com/hmans/three-elements), Web Components wrappers for Three.js.
