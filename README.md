## Hi! 👋

I'm an open source developer from Germany working on tooling for web-first game development. Here's an overview of my active projects. Follow my [public roadmap](https://github.com/users/hmans/projects/7) to see what I'm working on right now, and what I will be working on next.

## Libraries

### State Management

- 🤖 [Miniplex](https://github.com/hmans/miniplex), an Entity Component System library designed for ease-of-use and development ergonomics. Includes React bindings, but can also be used without a framework.
- 🚜 [State Composer](https://github.com/hmans/composer-suite/tree/main/packages/state-composer), a high-level finite state machine library for macro state in React applications.
- 🍍 [Statery](https://github.com/hmans/statery), a simple proxy-based state container for React.
- ⏰ [Timeline Composer](https://github.com/hmans/timeline-composer), a small collection of React components for orchestrating timelines.

### Graphics

- 🌈 [Shader Composer](https://github.com/hmans/composer-suite/tree/main/packages/shader-composer), a library for creating GLSL shaders from a tree of JS primitives (think ShaderGraph et al, but code.)
- 🎆 [VFX Composer](https://github.com/hmans/composer-suite/tree/main/packages/vfx-composer), a high-performance, game-ready visual effects library for Three.js and react-three-fiber.
- 🖼 [Render Composer](https://github.com/hmans/composer-suite/tree/main/packages/render-composer), a preconfigured, customizable render pipeline for react-three-fiber games.

### Noteworthy projects from the past

- [three-elements](https://github.com/hmans/three-elements), Web Components wrappers for Three.js.
