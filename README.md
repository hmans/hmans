Hi! Most of the opensourcey stuff I'm doing at the moment revolves around tooling for HTML5-native game development. Here are some of the projects I'm working on:

- [Miniplex](https://github.com/hmans/miniplex), a gentle entity manager for games based on ECS architecture.
- [ControlFreak](https://github.com/hmans/controlfreak), composable multi-device game input.
- [Ingrid](https://github.com/hmans/ingrid), an implementation of Spatial Hash Grids.

Get in touch! Find me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hmans) or [the Poimandres Discord](https://discord.gg/aAYjm2p7c7).
